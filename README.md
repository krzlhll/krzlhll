- 👋 Hi, I’m Halil
- 👀 I’m interested in delivery and maintenance of the software systems/applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the DevOps way of doing delivery and maintenance including how to apply ITIL/SRE practices along the way. I'm also learning AWS services & Kubernetes in details (I have Openshift experience). Not the last one but also trying to improve my Python/Go skills (I have already basic skills to develop "not complex" solutions to fix production issues and/or automation). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the projects where I can add some value and gain some insights and experience in return.
