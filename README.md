- 👋 Hi, I’m Halil
- 👀 I’m interested in delivery and maintenance of the software systems/applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the DevOps way of doing delivery and maintenance. Including how to apply ITIL / SRE practices along the way. I'm also currently learning some AWS services, also Kubernetes (I have Openshift experience). Not not the last one but also trying to improve Python/Go skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the projects where I can add some value and gain some insights and experience in return.
